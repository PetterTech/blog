I have always been careful to avoid the really advanced and cool stuff in Powershell, like functions, arrays and such.

But as I created the last script it hit me that it would be really cool to have it in a command, like set-adphoto. After some googling I found that funtions aren&#8217;t hard at all!

Basically all I really had to do with the ad photo import script was to addÂ &#8220;function Set-ADPhoto { &#8221; in front of the script and end it with a }

But since I already was at it I decided to to a little more, I added some argument handling and a little help file.

Here is the result:

 ```
 function Set-ADPhoto ($user,$photopath) {
Import-Module active*

$error = "The file is bigger than 12KB. Shrink it or choose another file"
$file = Get-Item "$photopath"
$filesize = $file.length/1KB



if ($filesize -gt 12)
    {
    Write-Host $error
        }
else {
    $photo = [byte[]](get-content $file -Encoding byte)
    Set-ADUser $user -Replace @{thumbnailPhoto=$photo}
        }
<#
.SYNOPSIS
