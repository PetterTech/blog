Robert van den Nieuwendijk has a nice post on how to use PowerCLI to find VMs that need consolidation and then how to start consolidation. You can that post here:Â <a href="http://rvdnieuwendijk.com/2012/09/26/use-powercli-to-consolidate-snapshots-in-vsphere-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://rvdnieuwendijk.com/2012/09/26/use-powercli-to-consolidate-snapshots-in-vsphere-5/</a>

But, as always, I prefer to make a function of these kind of things. A function is much easier to remember than a bunch of parameters and cmdlets.  
So here&#8217;s the code for a function that will search through the vCentre for VMs that need disk consolidation:

 ```
function Start-Consolidation
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
        Param (
            [string]$Location = '*',
            [switch]$ListOnly
              )

        $VMs = Get-VM -Location $Location | Where-Object {$_.Extensiondata.Runtime.ConsolidationNeeded}

        if ($ListOnly) {
              $VMs
              }

        else {
            $VMs | ForEach-Object {
                Write-Host "Starting disk consolidation on $_.Name"
                $_.ExtensionData.ConsolidateVMDisks()
                Write-Host "Finished disk consolidation on $_.Name"
                                  }
              }
        }
