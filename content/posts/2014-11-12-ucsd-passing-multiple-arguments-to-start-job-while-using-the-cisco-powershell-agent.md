While theÂ Cisco PowerShell Agent (PSA) that can be used in UCS Director isn&#8217;t exactly perfect, it can still be put to good use. As long as you now how to use it properly ðŸ˜‰

The major issue with using the PSA is that it doesn&#8217;t stick around to see if the commands/script was successful or not. As long as it delivered the commands successfully, it&#8217;s happy and your workflow will continue to the next step.

Jon Hildebrand describes a nice way around this in one of his blog posts:Â <a href="http://snoopj.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/cisco-powershell-agent-service-and-vmware-vum-powercli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://snoopj.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/cisco-powershell-agent-service-and-vmware-vum-powercli/</a>

Using his approach, I was able get the PSA to stick around until the job finishes. However, I ran into a challenge when I wanted to pass multiple arguments to start-job. The solution I came up with was declaring the UCSD inputs I wanted to use as powershell variables in the script, before calling the start-job cmdlet. So the commands/script input looks like this:

 ```
$vm = "${custom_getVMDetails_7494.vmName}"
$annotation = "${Annotation}"
$annotationvalue = "${AnnotationValue}"
Start-Job -FilePath "C:\Powershell\Annotate-VM.ps1" -ArgumentList $vm,$annotation,$annotationvalue | Wait-Job 
```

In case you are wondering, this task is for setting annotations on a vm in vCenter.  
The powershell script I am calling is pretty simple:

 ```
 Param (
 [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,Position=0)][string]$VM,
 [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,Position=1)][string]$Annotation,
 [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,Position=2)][string]$AnnotationValue
 )
Add-PSSnapin vmware*
Connect-VIServer
Set-Annotation -Entity $VM -CustomAttribute "$($Annotation)" -Value "$($AnnotationValue)"
Disconnect-VIServer  -Confirm:$false 
```
