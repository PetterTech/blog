Easy-peasy and a pretty short post&#8230;

To get all vm&#8217;s with iso mounted:

 ```
Get-VM | Get-CDDrive | select @{N="VM";E="Parent"},IsoPath | where {$_.IsoPath -ne $null} 
```

Then, to dismount those:

 ```
Get-VM | Get-CDDrive | where {$_.IsoPath -ne $null}Â | Set-CDDrive -NoMedia -Confirm:$False 
```
