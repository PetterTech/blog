If you have taken a look at some of the scripts I have posted earlier you might have noticed a rather strange line, usually at the end of the script:

```
cmd /c pause | out-null
```

This was actually just to get the script to wait for the user to press a key. It is equivalent to the good ol' pause in batch scripting.  
The reason I used this method was that I just didn't know how to do this in Powershell (yes, I am ashamed). But now I have stumbled upon the Powershell way to do it:

```
$null = $host.ui.rawui.readkey("NoEcho,Includekeydown") 
```

This will do exactly the same as pause in batch scripting ðŸ™‚
