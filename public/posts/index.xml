      <description>Today I got a request from a colleague of mine that was doing inventory: What are the make, model, serial number and purchase date of your monitors?
Seeing as this wasn‚Äôt something I had readily in my head I had to figure it out, but being the automation enthusiast that I am, I refused to bend over my monitors and snap a photo of it all. I wanted to find it a cooler way, the powershell way üôÇ</description>

      <description>A while back we migrated from our old EMC VNX to a new HPE 3PAR array. It all went fine but what kinda slipped our mind is that HPE‚Äôs best practice is to create a custom SATP rule that uses RoudRobin as path selection policy and a IOPS limit to 1 in stead of the default 1000.
The steps are documented in the¬†HPE 3PAR VMware ESX/ESXi Implementation Guide, but they only show you how to do it through the esx cli.</description>

      <description>Lately, I‚Äôve had the pleasure of using Powershell to automate some of the basic tasks we do on our HPE 3PAR systems: creating volumes, adding them to volume sets, exporting them and so on.
Since my experience with REST APIs was rather limited it was quite daunting at first but once you get the hang of how REST works and the Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet it‚Äôs really not that bad.
Disclaimer: The examples below will vary somewhat in how I do certain things, simply because I had to learn all this from scratch.</description>

      <description>A tweet from @JanEgilRing caught my eye this morning, it¬†was showing¬†how you can use powershell to create passwords. The link in the tweet pointed here:¬†http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/tips/archive/2016/05/23/one-liner-random-password-generator.aspx
Seeing that line and realizing how simple it was, it got me thinking on¬†how I could implement this in my scripts.
The only issue I saw with that one-liner was that the passwords it creates do not necessarily comply¬†with high complexity rules.</description>

      <description>I have been struggling for quite some time with mapping luns from our vnx 5600 to entire clusters in our vCenter. We used to utilize a custom workflow a consultant wrote for us, but that workflow got borked after an update to UCS Director nearly a year ago.
Revisiting the issue i found this example from Cisco:¬†https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-57382
That example seems to work for other people but in our case the custom task in it never gave the correct output, so I had to look for a way around it.</description>

      <description>My last post described how to get around some issues with using Powershell tasks in workflows. While that post surely enables you to uilize powershell to do stuff for you, what about if you want Powershell to grab stuff for you and return them in a usable matter?
This time I‚Äôm going to show you how you can return a string from Powershell and use it further down in the workflow.</description>

      <description>While the¬†Cisco PowerShell Agent (PSA) that can be used in UCS Director isn‚Äôt exactly perfect, it can still be put to good use. As long as you now how to use it properly üòâ
The major issue with using the PSA is that it doesn‚Äôt stick around to see if the commands/script was successful or not. As long as it delivered the commands successfully, it‚Äôs happy and your workflow will continue to the next step.</description>

      <description>My very first PowerCLI related post was about this same topic: listing snapshot info using PowerCLI.
In my original post (which you can see here) I only wrote a pretty simple one-liner. Which was kind of okay, but it was missing one crucial thing: who took the snapshot?
Why vmware hasn‚Äôt found a way to include a username in the get-snapshot cmdlet is something I just can‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs really not much code needed to add this to the output, and there‚Äôs several ways of doing so.</description>

      <description>In case you ever need to empty out a datastore in you vmware environment, there is a nice little one-liner in PowerCLI for that:
Where ‚Äúdatastore1‚Äù is the datastore you want to empty out and ‚Äúcluster1‚Äù is the cluster where the datastore is available.
The command will move VMs from datastore1 to the datastore in cluster1 with the most available space (minimum 500GB)</description>

      <description>For almost a year ago, I posted a simple one-liner to list all VMs who has ISOs mounted. You can view that post here:¬†http://cloud.kemta.net/2013/10/powershell-vmware-list-all-vms-with-iso-mounted-and-dismount-them/
That post was written before I truly discovered the major advantages of using Get-View instead of Get-VM, Get-VMHost and so on. If used correctly, there‚Äôs a major difference in speed when using Get-View over Get-VM.
When writing this post I checked the differences in speed when using the old way that I linked to above and my new function (which I‚Äôll get to in a second or two.</description>

      <description>I love a powershell challenge, and last week a colleague of mine asked me for assistance in getting the uptime of vmware hosts. My initial response did the trick:
However, I wasn‚Äôt completely satisfied by the the output or the ease of use.
So today I went back and rewrote the code and made a function of it.
Instead of using the ToString and Substring methods I went for the built-in class Math, which has a method called Round.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to explain to you guys why VMware tools is a good idea to have installed on your VMs, and probably not why it‚Äôs a good idea to keep VMware tools updated.
However, I haven‚Äôt found a good way to get a neat list of which VMs need to have their VMware tools upgraded. While working on my vCenter health check script I found that I had to make my own little script to get that list.</description>

      <description>The next step in my short series on getting vCenter alarms using PowerCLI is to get cluster alarms.
Here‚Äôs the code:
And the output will look something like this:
As you can see, this will also list vm alarms and host alarms. So you could argue that you only need this and not separate scripts/functions for getting vm alarms and host alarms.
Anyways, here‚Äôs the function code:
The output will be the same, but since it‚Äôs a function you can manipulate the data further.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I started to put together a health check script for our vmware environments and the first thing I wanted to have in that report is a list of triggered alarms. To my surprise there was no native cmdlet to retrieve alarms using PowerCLI, instead I had to write a short script to retrieve alarms.
So here‚Äôs the the script for retrieving vm alarms:

      <description>Ever had a bunch of vmware hosts that you want to add a NFS datastore on? It can be quite time consuming to say the least.
In our environment we have a couple of NFS stores that should be available on all vmware hosts and I really don‚Äôt want to browse around all 50 or so hosts and check if they have them and then mount them if they‚Äôre not available.</description>

      <description>If you are using a KMS server for activating servers and clients in your environment, you may have noticed that there‚Äôs really no obvious way to get a list of all the clients that have been activated by the KMS server.
One way to get that overview is by using VAMT (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824953.aspx), but since that tool is based on pulling info from clients and not from the KMS server it is not suitable for everyone.</description>

After some digging it occurred to me that this may be DNS related, so I used a one-liner in powershell to see how fast our DNS servers responded:
And sure enough, we were seeing response times in the range of 5-7 seconds.</description>

This will show a quick progress bar stating that ‚ÄúSomething‚Äù is going on, the status is ‚ÄúSomething else‚Äù and it has gotten to 30%. However, when I wanted to use Write-Progress in a large script I quickly got confused when I looked at some of the examples out there.</description>

      <description>To find out to which vm a MAC address belongs, you can use a simple one-liner:
(Courtesy of this page:¬†http://www.virtu-al.net/2009/07/07/powercli-more-one-liner-power/ )
Thats really great, and you can easily extend the one-liner to include more data if you like. But for someone who isn‚Äôt comfortable with using PowerCLI yet, it can seem a bit terrifying. Therefore I usually create functions for long one-liners like this one.
A basic function doing the same thing can look something like this:</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs been a while since last update, again, so I figured I should at least provide something..
I recently started in a new job, and one of the first things I looked into was the amount of snapshots in our vmware environments. Not surprisingly there was a lot of snapshots, and very few of them had any hints of when they were taken and why.
The vsphere console doesn‚Äôt provide this info so I had to turn to PowerCLI to get the info I needed.</description>

      <description>If you ever had problems with corrupt databases in an Exchange 2010 DAG setup you might have encountered this error. Trying to activate the database on a server where it has this state will fail.
However there is a quite simple fix given that you have a healthy copy of the database on a different server:
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB -SourceServer -CatalogOnly
Run the command in the Exchange Management Shell and it should fix the Content index state and allow you to activate the database again.</description>

What the function does is gather some system information using get-wmiobject. The info is written to a temp file and then shown using out-gridview.
If the KeepTempFile parameter is used the temp file is saved in the users profile, if not it is deleted after the function finishes.</description>

If this makes absolutely no sense to you I will explain:
When you run commands like traceroute, ping and others within Cisco IOS you can abort them. But you can‚Äôt use the usual ctrl+c (that would be to logical I guess), you need to press ctrl+shift+6 and THEN press x.
There‚Äôs probably a good explanation for this, but I still feel that it is horribly cumbersome.</description>

Use it at your own will, I‚Äôm just posting it so I know where to find it the next time I need it üôÇ</description>

      <description>If you are used to working with Linux you‚Äôre probably familiar with using tail, grep and such for gathering stuff from logs and other files. Those are quite useful tools and work very well when you want to find out e.g. why a user fails to log in.
In Windows it‚Äôs a little different, if we want to find something in the event logs we have always had to resort to a console.</description>

      <description>Earlier I posted a script that created users and homefolders and added the users to specified groups. It also set ntfs permissions on the homefolders.
That script used primarily old fashioned stuff, so I sat down and started looking for a neat way to do the same in powershell.
The powershell script I came up does a lot more than the last one. Here a little list:
Creates OUs Creates users Creates security groups Creates distribution groups Creates mailboxes for all users Add specified users to the correct security and distribution groups Creates a homefolder root folder and shares it Creates a homefolder for each user and sets ntfs permissions Set storage limit on the exchange mailbox database As you can see, it does quite a lot.</description>

One example from where I currently work is printers.
We never set up the printers ourselves, that job is done by the provider. And do we want to give them a username and password allowing for mail relay through our servers? No, we don‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs a better practice to have them only input the name/ip-address of one exchange server with the cas role.</description>

      <description>Did you know you use an SSH connection as a proxy using PuTTY? I didn‚Äôt until today üôÇ
Fire up PuTTY but before you connect navigate to Connection‚Äì&amp;gt;SSH‚Äì&amp;gt;Tunnels.
Here you can specify a port you want PuTTY to respond to proxy requests. Choose a port that is not in use on your localhost, I will use 8080 in this example. Choose Dynamic on Destination and click Add.
In the forwarded ports part of the windows you will now see D8080.</description>

      <description>From time to time you will want to reinstall you os right? And of course you have all your license keys documented right?
Well, I don‚Äôt üôÇ
Thats why I usually extract them from my computer before i reinstall the os.
A nice little tool that I have been using for this is ProduKey.
It has a small footprint, no need for installation, just run the exe file.
It gathers your licensekeys for windows, office, exchange, sql etc.</description>

      <description>Stumbled upon a tool from Microsoft called ALTools that I thought were absolutely awesome. It‚Äôs over 7 years old so I wonder why I haven‚Äôt seen it before
Nevertheless it‚Äôs as cool now as it was when it was released.
ALTools consists of several tools, but the coolest of them are:
aloinfo ‚Äì Displays all user account names and the age of their passwords eventcombMT ‚Äì Gathers specific events from event logs of several different machines and saves them in a text file LockoutStatus ‚Äì Shows a list of all domain controllers in a given domain and the lockoutstatus of a given user on those I have used eventcomb a couple of times as it has some predefined searches, for example Account Lockouts.</description>

      <description>At the company where I currently work we lease a bunch of Xerox copiers. Those leasing contracts are based on number of prints per device.
That means that once a month we have to gather pagecounts from all our printers (about 100 of them) and report them to our supplier, which takes a lot of time.
Since we already were using Zenoss for monitoring of the printers I figured I could try and gather the information via snmp.</description>
