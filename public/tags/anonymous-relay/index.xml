      <description>Often it’s a good idea to have a receive connector allowing certain devices to send mail through you exchange server without having to authenticate.
One example from where I currently work is printers.
We never set up the printers ourselves, that job is done by the provider. And do we want to give them a username and password allowing for mail relay through our servers? No, we don’t.
It’s a better practice to have them only input the name/ip-address of one exchange server with the cas role.</description>
