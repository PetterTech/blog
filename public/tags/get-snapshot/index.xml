      <description>My very first PowerCLI related post was about this same topic: listing snapshot info using PowerCLI.
In my original post (which you can see here) I only wrote a pretty simple one-liner. Which was kind of okay, but it was missing one crucial thing: who took the snapshot?
Why vmware hasn’t found a way to include a username in the get-snapshot cmdlet is something I just can’t understand. There’s really not much code needed to add this to the output, and there’s several ways of doing so.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since last update, again, so I figured I should at least provide something..
I recently started in a new job, and one of the first things I looked into was the amount of snapshots in our vmware environments. Not surprisingly there was a lot of snapshots, and very few of them had any hints of when they were taken and why.
The vsphere console doesn’t provide this info so I had to turn to PowerCLI to get the info I needed.</description>
