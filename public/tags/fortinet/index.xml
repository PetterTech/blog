      <description>Iâ€™ve put together a small guide for setting up two Fortigates with failover ospf routing. This example is based on a small lab, but you can easily adapt it to your own environment.
This is the scenario:
In this scenario we want the 100Mb line to be prioritized.
Start of with setting up the two Fortigates with ip-adresses as shown. Also make sure to create firewall rules for traffic from internal to wan1 and wan2 and back (make sure not to enabel NAT).</description>

      <description>Setting up an HA cluster on Fortigate devices is surprisingly easy, heres a short little guide:
Set up the first Fortigate the way you want it (or perhaps you already have one in you environment).
Then click on configure, next to HA Status on the main page.
Type in the name and password for the HA group you want to create.
Choose which interfaces you want the heartbeat to be sent over (I recommend at least to interfaces, one of them being dedicated to heartbeat).</description>
