      <description>I better write this down before I forget it again: ctrl+shift+6 x
If this makes absolutely no sense to you I will explain:
When you run commands like traceroute, ping and others within Cisco IOS you can abort them. But you can’t use the usual ctrl+c (that would be to logical I guess), you need to press ctrl+shift+6 and THEN press x.
There’s probably a good explanation for this, but I still feel that it is horribly cumbersome.</description>

      <description>At work I was recently assigned some more network related task.
One of the task I fine myself repeating over and over is locating a computer on the network. The only info you need is the ip-address of the computer.</description>
