      <description>To find out to which vm a MAC address belongs, you can use a simple one-liner:
(Courtesy of this page: http://www.virtu-al.net/2009/07/07/powercli-more-one-liner-power/ )
Thats really great, and you can easily extend the one-liner to include more data if you like. But for someone who isn’t comfortable with using PowerCLI yet, it can seem a bit terrifying. Therefore I usually create functions for long one-liners like this one.
A basic function doing the same thing can look something like this:</description>

      <description>Easy-peasy and a pretty short post…
To get all vm’s with iso mounted:
Then, to dismount those:</description>

      <description>PowerCLI is just awsome 🙂
This simple one-liner migrates all vm’s off one datastore to a new one:
You can also move vm’s off one datastore and place them in any datastore within a specified datastore cluster:</description>

      <title>PowerCLI: List all snapshots</title>

      <description>It’s been a while since last update, again, so I figured I should at least provide something..
I recently started in a new job, and one of the first things I looked into was the amount of snapshots in our vmware environments. Not surprisingly there was a lot of snapshots, and very few of them had any hints of when they were taken and why.
The vsphere console doesn’t provide this info so I had to turn to PowerCLI to get the info I needed.</description>
