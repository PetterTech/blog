      <description>Today I got a request from a colleague of mine that was doing inventory: What are the make, model, serial number and purchase date of your monitors?
Seeing as this wasn‚Äôt something I had readily in my head I had to figure it out, but being the automation enthusiast that I am, I refused to bend over my monitors and snap a photo of it all. I wanted to find it a cooler way, the powershell way üôÇ</description>

      <description>Lately, I‚Äôve had the pleasure of using Powershell to automate some of the basic tasks we do on our HPE 3PAR systems: creating volumes, adding them to volume sets, exporting them and so on.
Since my experience with REST APIs was rather limited it was quite daunting at first but once you get the hang of how REST works and the Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet it‚Äôs really not that bad.
Disclaimer: The examples below will vary somewhat in how I do certain things, simply because I had to learn all this from scratch.</description>

      <description>A tweet from @JanEgilRing caught my eye this morning, it¬†was showing¬†how you can use powershell to create passwords. The link in the tweet pointed here:¬†http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/tips/archive/2016/05/23/one-liner-random-password-generator.aspx
Seeing that line and realizing how simple it was, it got me thinking on¬†how I could implement this in my scripts.
The only issue I saw with that one-liner was that the passwords it creates do not necessarily comply¬†with high complexity rules.</description>

      <description>I have been struggling for quite some time with mapping luns from our vnx 5600 to entire clusters in our vCenter. We used to utilize a custom workflow a consultant wrote for us, but that workflow got borked after an update to UCS Director nearly a year ago.
Revisiting the issue i found this example from Cisco:¬†https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-57382
That example seems to work for other people but in our case the custom task in it never gave the correct output, so I had to look for a way around it.</description>

This time I‚Äôm going to show you how you can return a string from Powershell and use it further down in the workflow.</description>

      <description>My very first PowerCLI related post was about this same topic: listing snapshot info using PowerCLI.
In my original post (which you can see here) I only wrote a pretty simple one-liner. Which was kind of okay, but it was missing one crucial thing: who took the snapshot?
Why vmware hasn‚Äôt found a way to include a username in the get-snapshot cmdlet is something I just can‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs really not much code needed to add this to the output, and there‚Äôs several ways of doing so.</description>

      <description>In case you ever need to empty out a datastore in you vmware environment, there is a nice little one-liner in PowerCLI for that:
Where ‚Äúdatastore1‚Äù is the datastore you want to empty out and ‚Äúcluster1‚Äù is the cluster where the datastore is available.
The command will move VMs from datastore1 to the datastore in cluster1 with the most available space (minimum 500GB)</description>

      <description>I love a powershell challenge, and last week a colleague of mine asked me for assistance in getting the uptime of vmware hosts. My initial response did the trick:
However, I wasn‚Äôt completely satisfied by the the output or the ease of use.
So today I went back and rewrote the code and made a function of it.
Instead of using the ToString and Substring methods I went for the built-in class Math, which has a method called Round.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to explain to you guys why VMware tools is a good idea to have installed on your VMs, and probably not why it‚Äôs a good idea to keep VMware tools updated.
However, I haven‚Äôt found a good way to get a neat list of which VMs need to have their VMware tools upgraded. While working on my vCenter health check script I found that I had to make my own little script to get that list.</description>

      <description>The next step in my short series on getting vCenter alarms using PowerCLI is to get cluster alarms.
Here‚Äôs the code:
And the output will look something like this:
As you can see, this will also list vm alarms and host alarms. So you could argue that you only need this and not separate scripts/functions for getting vm alarms and host alarms.
Anyways, here‚Äôs the function code:
The output will be the same, but since it‚Äôs a function you can manipulate the data further.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I started to put together a health check script for our vmware environments and the first thing I wanted to have in that report is a list of triggered alarms. To my surprise there was no native cmdlet to retrieve alarms using PowerCLI, instead I had to write a short script to retrieve alarms.
So here‚Äôs the the script for retrieving vm alarms:

      <description>Ever had a bunch of vmware hosts that you want to add a NFS datastore on? It can be quite time consuming to say the least.
In our environment we have a couple of NFS stores that should be available on all vmware hosts and I really don‚Äôt want to browse around all 50 or so hosts and check if they have them and then mount them if they‚Äôre not available.</description>

      <description>If you are using a KMS server for activating servers and clients in your environment, you may have noticed that there‚Äôs really no obvious way to get a list of all the clients that have been activated by the KMS server.
One way to get that overview is by using VAMT (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824953.aspx), but since that tool is based on pulling info from clients and not from the KMS server it is not suitable for everyone.</description>

      <description>A little while ago we have some issues with one of our Exchange environments. The symptoms was that basically everything was slow, opening address books, owa, sending mails and so on.
After some digging it occurred to me that this may be DNS related, so I used a one-liner in powershell to see how fast our DNS servers responded:
And sure enough, we were seeing response times in the range of 5-7 seconds.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, I had a really difficult time wrapping my head around the usage of Write-Progress. The basic usage is off-course quite easy:
This will show a quick progress bar stating that ‚ÄúSomething‚Äù is going on, the status is ‚ÄúSomething else‚Äù and it has gotten to 30%. However, when I wanted to use Write-Progress in a large script I quickly got confused when I looked at some of the examples out there.</description>

      <description>To find out to which vm a MAC address belongs, you can use a simple one-liner:
(Courtesy of this page:¬†http://www.virtu-al.net/2009/07/07/powercli-more-one-liner-power/ )
Thats really great, and you can easily extend the one-liner to include more data if you like. But for someone who isn‚Äôt comfortable with using PowerCLI yet, it can seem a bit terrifying. Therefore I usually create functions for long one-liners like this one.
A basic function doing the same thing can look something like this:</description>

I recently started in a new job, and one of the first things I looked into was the amount of snapshots in our vmware environments. Not surprisingly there was a lot of snapshots, and very few of them had any hints of when they were taken and why.
The vsphere console doesn‚Äôt provide this info so I had to turn to PowerCLI to get the info I needed.</description>

Working in Norway with users from all the Nordic countries means that we have a lot of users i Active Directory who have non-English letters in their names (√¶ √∏ √• √∂ √§ and so on).</description>

      <description>If you ever had problems with corrupt databases in an Exchange 2010 DAG setup you might have encountered this error. Trying to activate the database on a server where it has this state will fail.
However there is a quite simple fix given that you have a healthy copy of the database on a different server:
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB -SourceServer -CatalogOnly
Run the command in the Exchange Management Shell and it should fix the Content index state and allow you to activate the database again.</description>

      <description>I don‚Äôt know how useful this will be for others, but in our case we had a need to check a few public dns records on some of our domains. Doing so by using a web portal will be time consuming and straight out boring. Luckily you can use Powershell for such things:
First we need to to save our domains in an array:
Then we send that array into a foreach loop:</description>

      <description>A little while ago I posted a script for enabling users for Lync and settings some settings for that user. That script has been used here ever since I posted it and it has worked like a charm. However there‚Äôs always room for improvement, right?.
So I have made a function out of it and for the first time (I think) I have even implemented some error handling. The function is also improved quit a bit on the help section and the info that is shown to the user after the function completes.</description>

      <description>This is a function I created just because I wanted to toy around with Powershell and get-wmiobject. Also, this is my first function where I made it possible to use a switch parameter.
What the function does is gather some system information using get-wmiobject. The info is written to a temp file and then shown using out-gridview.
If the KeepTempFile parameter is used the temp file is saved in the users profile, if not it is deleted after the function finishes.</description>

This was actually just to get the script to wait for the user to press a key. It is equivalent to the good ol‚Äô pause in batch scripting.
The reason I used this method was that I just didn‚Äôt know how to do this in Powershell (yes, I am ashamed).</description>

Well, challenge accepted!
The reason the challenge arose is due to maintenance he performs on a number of customer servers. Every month he saves each eventlog and clears it manually, a time consuming task if you have more than a few servers.
So here‚Äôs what I came up with:</description>

As this was within our own Exchange organization it proved to be quite simple:
You can achieve the goal with a simple one-liner:
But wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to have it in a function? In Powershell, creating functions isn‚Äôt all that hard. Basically all you need to do is wrap the command or script block with a function statement, see here:</description>

This script is a simple script that adds a photo to a user‚Äôs active directory user object. It also checks the filesize to prevent users adding large photos (you can of course change this limit).
The requirements for this script is the Active Directory module and permission to edit a user object in Active Directory</description>

      <description>If you are using DAG in exchange 2010 for high availability on your mailboxes there may be one thing you might have noticed, the databases can fail over to a less preferred server at any time without you noticing.
Microsoft have provided you with a script for balancing these databases, RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1. With this script you can activate the databases on their preferred server again. But how do you know when they have failed over?</description>

      <description>Earlier I posted a script that created users and homefolders and added the users to specified groups. It also set ntfs permissions on the homefolders.
That script used primarily old fashioned stuff, so I sat down and started looking for a neat way to do the same in powershell.
The powershell script I came up does a lot more than the last one. Here a little list:
Creates OUs Creates users Creates security groups Creates distribution groups Creates mailboxes for all users Add specified users to the correct security and distribution groups Creates a homefolder root folder and shares it Creates a homefolder for each user and sets ntfs permissions Set storage limit on the exchange mailbox database As you can see, it does quite a lot.</description>

      <description>Often it‚Äôs a good idea to have a receive connector allowing certain devices to send mail through you exchange server without having to authenticate.
One example from where I currently work is printers.
We never set up the printers ourselves, that job is done by the provider. And do we want to give them a username and password allowing for mail relay through our servers? No, we don‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs a better practice to have them only input the name/ip-address of one exchange server with the cas role.</description>
