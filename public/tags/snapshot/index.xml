      <description>It’s been a while since last update, again, so I figured I should at least provide something..
I recently started in a new job, and one of the first things I looked into was the amount of snapshots in our vmware environments. Not surprisingly there was a lot of snapshots, and very few of them had any hints of when they were taken and why.
The vsphere console doesn’t provide this info so I had to turn to PowerCLI to get the info I needed.</description>
