Especially when we are finally looking at a datacenter license from Microsoft and we already have the System Center suite. This means that we can save a ton of money on switching from vmware to Hyper-V.\nAnyway‚Ä¶In this blogpost I want to show you a little about the HP Array Configuration Utility command-line interface.\nI usually use the graphical interface for creating volumes and such, but for some reason I couldn‚Äôt get it working on my Hyper-V test server. So instead of looking on how to fix that I decided to give the cli a shot. What I want to achieve with this post is to show you how the steps you need after putting one or more new disks in the server.\nThe ACU cli can be launched by running¬†C:Program Files (x86)CompaqHpacucliBinhpacucli.exe.\nThe first command you should know about is ‚Äúcontroller all show‚Äù, this will show you all the controllers installed in the server. The output will look something like this:\nThis show that my controller is installed in slot 0, to get some more info on this controller I could run ‚Äúcontroller slot=0 show‚Äù, the output should look something like this:\nOn my test server I have already created a mirrored volume on which I have installed Hyper-V. I have only one extra disk, so I cannot show you how to create a fancy raid configuration but nevertheless I will show you how to create an array and a logical disk.\nThe first thing we need to do is to find any unassigned disk connected to the controller. This is done by running the command ‚Äúcontroller slot=0 physicaldrive allunassigned show‚Äù (replace slot=0 with the slot where your controller is connected). The output will look something like this:\nSo here we see that I have one unassigned disk that I can use. Given that I want to use all unassigned disks to create a new logical disk in a new array I can run the command ‚Äúcontroller slot=0 create type=ld drives=allunassigned raid=0‚Äù\nThis will create a new array and a new logical drive that uses all unassigned drives, the raid level is 0 (striping)\nThats basically what you need to do from the acu. But before you can use the disk in Windows you need to initialize it, create a partition and so on, the required steps could be something like this:\n",
