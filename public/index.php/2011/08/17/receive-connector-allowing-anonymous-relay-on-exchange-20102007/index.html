And do we want to give them a username and password allowing for mail relay through our servers? No, we don’t.\nIt’s a better practice to have them only input the name/ip-address of one exchange server with the cas role. Then all we have to do is add the ip-address of the printer to the list of allowed ip’s on our receive connector. Here’s a short guide on how to do it:\nOpen up the EMC on a exchange server with the cas role and navigate to Server Configuration–\u003eHub transport. On the right side, click New Receive Connector… Give the new receive connector a suitable name, for example Anonymous, and choose Custom as the intended use. On the next page you are prompted to choose which local ip-addresses the receive connector should receive mail on and what fqdn the server should respond with. I usually leave the default settings here, but if your server has multiple ip-addresses connecting to different secured/unsecured networks it is a good idea to not accept mail on all ip-addresses. Next you will choose what ip-addresses are allowed to send mail to the receive connector, the default is all ip-addresses (baad idea in our case). Here you would, in our example, remove the default setting and input the ip-address of our printer. Click New on the next page and the connector is created, but we still have to do some configuring. When back at EMC, hit properties on the newly created receive connector. On the Permissions tab you can remove everything but Anonymous users and click OK. Then you are good to go. If you want to allow more ip-addresses to relay, you can always enter more of them on the Properties–\u003eNetwork for the receive connector.\nAnd, as always, here’s the nerdy way of doing it in powershell:\nNew-ReceiveConnector -Name \"Anonymous\" -Usage Custom -PermissionGroups AnonymousUsers -Bindings 0.0.0.0:25 -RemoteIpRanges \u0026lt;ip of printer\u0026gt; -server \u0026lt;name of your server\u0026gt; ",
