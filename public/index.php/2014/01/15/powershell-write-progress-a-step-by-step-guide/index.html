<p>So let‚Äôs write a simpler guide!</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start by explaining a briefly how Write-Progress works:<br>
If you type the command in your Powershell console it will display the progress bar, but it will disappear again in a split second.<br>
If you put your Write-Progress snippet in a script, the progress bar will be displayed until another Write-Progress snippet comes along, or until the script finishes.</p>
<p>The basic usage of Write-Progress is, as I wrote further up, something like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That will create an output looking something like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It‚Äôs also quite easy to create a child progress bar by using the Id and ParentId parameters:</p>

<p>This will create an output looking something like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cool ey?</p>
<p>Now, this is all fine and dandy as a starting point, and you CAN use write-progress this way in your scripts, but thats not exactly a dynamic way of doing it.<br>
Often in your script you will have one or more foreach loops. Those are a great place to put your write-progress snippet and have PercentComplete and perhaps even Status or CurrentOperation filled out automagically.</p>
<p>First off we will need some data to parse through, I like to use Get-Process for that:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then we create a variable for our progress and set it to 1:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This way PercentComplete will start at 1, you‚Äôll see why in a bit.</p>
<p>Now we can create our foreach loop (I assume you know how they work):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This Write-Progress line will show Activity as ‚ÄúSleeping‚Äù, the status will be the name of the process and currentoperation will be the ID of the process. Percentagecomplete will the correct progress (since $progress++ will increment $progress by 1 for each time the loop runs).<br>
Start-Sleep is only there to delay the operation, so you can actually see whats going on.</p>
<p>So the final result will be:</p>
