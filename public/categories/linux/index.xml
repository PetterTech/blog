      <description>This is kinda the nerdy way of remoting a pc on a remote network. Usually a vpn connection would be preffered, but in my case I don’t want to forward the rdp port of security reasons.
Lets use my setup as an example:
At home I have a server running Debian linux, I also have several windows pc’s that I want to be able to use remote desktop to. Since I have already forwarded the ssh port (22) to my Debian server I figured I could use it as a jumpstation.</description>

      <description>A little list of some nifty packages for Debian:
sudo
Oddly enough this isn’t installed by default. Well known for most Linux users, but it enables regular users to perform commands as root without actually logging in as root.
**molly-guard
** Protects you from shutting down wrong server when using ssh to a server. What it does is ask you which server you want to shutdown when you run the command shutdown.</description>
