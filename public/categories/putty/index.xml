      <description>This is kinda the nerdy way of remoting a pc on a remote network. Usually a vpn connection would be preffered, but in my case I donâ€™t want to forward the rdp port of security reasons.
Lets use my setup as an example:
At home I have a server running Debian linux, I also have several windows pcâ€™s that I want to be able to use remote desktop to. Since I have already forwarded the ssh port (22) to my Debian server I figured I could use it as a jumpstation.</description>

      <description>Did you know you use an SSH connection as a proxy using PuTTY? I didnâ€™t until today ðŸ™‚
Fire up PuTTY but before you connect navigate to Connectionâ€“&amp;gt;SSHâ€“&amp;gt;Tunnels.
Here you can specify a port you want PuTTY to respond to proxy requests. Choose a port that is not in use on your localhost, I will use 8080 in this example. Choose Dynamic on Destination and click Add.
In the forwarded ports part of the windows you will now see D8080.</description>
