      <description>Today I got a request from a colleague of mine that was doing inventory: What are the make, model, serial number and purchase date of your monitors?
Seeing as this wasn’t something I had readily in my head I had to figure it out, but being the automation enthusiast that I am, I refused to bend over my monitors and snap a photo of it all. I wanted to find it a cooler way, the powershell way 🙂</description>

      <description>A tweet from @JanEgilRing caught my eye this morning, it was showing how you can use powershell to create passwords. The link in the tweet pointed here: http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/tips/archive/2016/05/23/one-liner-random-password-generator.aspx
Seeing that line and realizing how simple it was, it got me thinking on how I could implement this in my scripts.
The only issue I saw with that one-liner was that the passwords it creates do not necessarily comply with high complexity rules.</description>

      <description>If you are using a KMS server for activating servers and clients in your environment, you may have noticed that there’s really no obvious way to get a list of all the clients that have been activated by the KMS server.
One way to get that overview is by using VAMT (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824953.aspx), but since that tool is based on pulling info from clients and not from the KMS server it is not suitable for everyone.</description>

      <description>A little while ago we have some issues with one of our Exchange environments. The symptoms was that basically everything was slow, opening address books, owa, sending mails and so on.
After some digging it occurred to me that this may be DNS related, so I used a one-liner in powershell to see how fast our DNS servers responded:
And sure enough, we were seeing response times in the range of 5-7 seconds.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, I had a really difficult time wrapping my head around the usage of Write-Progress. The basic usage is off-course quite easy:
This will show a quick progress bar stating that “Something” is going on, the status is “Something else” and it has gotten to 30%. However, when I wanted to use Write-Progress in a large script I quickly got confused when I looked at some of the examples out there.</description>

      <description>Today I was presented with a task that sounded pretty boring and repetitive: Install the Windows Search service on all our citrix servers.
Now, I could just log on each and every one of our citrix servers, open Server Manager and then install the role service but where’s the fun in that?
As always Powershell is a lot more fun:
First I had to find the name of all our citrix servers.</description>

      <description>The Export-Csv cmdlet is a really nice tool if you want to gather info from e.g. Active Directory that you later want to import to Excel. But as you might have noticed it doesn’t play well with non-English letters.
Working in Norway with users from all the Nordic countries means that we have a lot of users i Active Directory who have non-English letters in their names (æ ø å ö ä and so on).</description>

      <description>If you ever had problems with corrupt databases in an Exchange 2010 DAG setup you might have encountered this error. Trying to activate the database on a server where it has this state will fail.
However there is a quite simple fix given that you have a healthy copy of the database on a different server:
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB -SourceServer -CatalogOnly
Run the command in the Exchange Management Shell and it should fix the Content index state and allow you to activate the database again.</description>

Trying to manually activate the database on server1, where is has an activation preference of 1, resulted in the following error:

      <description>OpenService FAILED 5: Access is denied. — “Oh crap!” If you ever see this error and need to reset the DACL on a Windows service, let’s say in case you (or someone else) accidentally deletes it, or configure it to something that prevents you from reading it’s security settings, this might do the trick:
First of all, get a cup of coffee.

      <description>I don’t know how useful this will be for others, but in our case we had a need to check a few public dns records on some of our domains. Doing so by using a web portal will be time consuming and straight out boring. Luckily you can use Powershell for such things:
First we need to to save our domains in an array:
Then we send that array into a foreach loop:</description>

      <description>A little while ago I posted a script for enabling users for Lync and settings some settings for that user. That script has been used here ever since I posted it and it has worked like a charm. However there’s always room for improvement, right?.
So I have made a function out of it and for the first time (I think) I have even implemented some error handling. The function is also improved quit a bit on the help section and the info that is shown to the user after the function completes.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine asked me a couple of days ago if I knew a way to gather users who are members of given groups. I thought to myself “Hmm, challenge accepted!” and started writing a small powershell script.
After he confirmed that the script worked as planned I decided to make a function of it (Yes, I know it has been a lot of them on this blog lately).</description>

      <description>This is a function I created just because I wanted to toy around with Powershell and get-wmiobject. Also, this is my first function where I made it possible to use a switch parameter.
What the function does is gather some system information using get-wmiobject. The info is written to a temp file and then shown using out-gridview.
If the KeepTempFile parameter is used the temp file is saved in the users profile, if not it is deleted after the function finishes.</description>

This was actually just to get the script to wait for the user to press a key. It is equivalent to the good ol’ pause in batch scripting.
The reason I used this method was that I just didn’t know how to do this in Powershell (yes, I am ashamed).</description>

Well, challenge accepted!
The reason the challenge arose is due to maintenance he performs on a number of customer servers. Every month he saves each eventlog and clears it manually, a time consuming task if you have more than a few servers.
So here’s what I came up with:</description>

As this was within our own Exchange organization it proved to be quite simple:
You can achieve the goal with a simple one-liner:
But wouldn’t it be easier to have it in a function? In Powershell, creating functions isn’t all that hard. Basically all you need to do is wrap the command or script block with a function statement, see here:</description>

But as I created the last script it hit me that it would be really cool to have it in a command, like set-adphoto. After some googling I found that funtions aren’t hard at all!
Basically all I really had to do with the ad photo import script was to add “function Set-ADPhoto { ” in front of the script and end it with a }</description>

This script is a simple script that adds a photo to a user’s active directory user object. It also checks the filesize to prevent users adding large photos (you can of course change this limit).
The requirements for this script is the Active Directory module and permission to edit a user object in Active Directory</description>

      <description>If you are using DAG in exchange 2010 for high availability on your mailboxes there may be one thing you might have noticed, the databases can fail over to a less preferred server at any time without you noticing.
Microsoft have provided you with a script for balancing these databases, RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1. With this script you can activate the databases on their preferred server again. But how do you know when they have failed over?</description>

In Windows it’s a little different, if we want to find something in the event logs we have always had to resort to a console.</description>

      <description>Earlier I posted a script that created users and homefolders and added the users to specified groups. It also set ntfs permissions on the homefolders.
That script used primarily old fashioned stuff, so I sat down and started looking for a neat way to do the same in powershell.
The powershell script I came up does a lot more than the last one. Here a little list:
Creates OUs Creates users Creates security groups Creates distribution groups Creates mailboxes for all users Add specified users to the correct security and distribution groups Creates a homefolder root folder and shares it Creates a homefolder for each user and sets ntfs permissions Set storage limit on the exchange mailbox database As you can see, it does quite a lot.</description>

      <description>I wrote this simple little script for enabling users for Lync. It asks for input on name, sipdomain and line uri. The rest is set using variables defined at the start of the script.
If you only have one sipdomain you can change the script so that it doesn’t ask for it.
Here’s the script in all its glory:

      <description>In this guide I will show you how to install and configure a simple Exchange 2010 environment using no gui at all.
Installing exchange 2010 without gui may seem kinda nerdy, but it’s quite useful for quickly setting up a test environment for example.
Remember to run Windows update prior to the installation.
Start powershell as administrator and type:
First we need to install all of the prerequisites:
We also need to set the NetTcpPortSharing service to automatic start, the command for this is:</description>

      <description>I am currently working on a script similar to the Mass import of users in Active Direcory post I published earlier (as promised 🙂 ). In the new script I wanted to only use powershell, so I had to find a way to set ntfs permissions using powershell. After all, the cacls way is pretty outdated.
After some googling I came up with a rather extensive script, it is a little more complicated than I wanted but here goes:</description>

      <description>This is a script I have used on several of my relatives computers for backing up their data. Windows backup won’t do for them because they feel the need to see the actual files on the external drive…
Anyway, heres my script:
I guess a little explanation is required.
The first part, robocopy c:users tells robocopy what to copy where. /MIR indicates that robocopy should mirror the source to the destination.</description>

      <description>The Resource Booking Attendant should be enabled on all your Room Mailboxes. If it is not, the room will not accept or decline incoming meeting requests. Which is somewhat the whole point right?
Heres a powershell command to enable it on all the Room Mailboxes in an exchange organization:</description>

      <description>Tried sleeping……That obviously didn’t work out, so here’s a guide on how to import a number of users in Active Directory and then creating and sharing out their home folder.
Note: This guide uses dsadd for creating users and cacls for setting ntfs permissions. Thats kind of old fashioned, I will try to write a new guide using powershell later on.
In the scenario I have created this script for we have a domain controller who happens to also be the file server, file01.</description>

      <description>Libraries can be a nice feature to use if you have your pictures, music, movies and whatnot spread across several different locations, be that discs, servers or folders.
It’s really simple to setup too!
Open up explorer and look to your left, there you will see the default Libraries Windows has set up.
You can use the default Libraries as a starting point, or you can create a new one by right-clicking Libraries New–&amp;gt;Library</description>

      <description>If you have some sort of 3rd-party application that needs access to all of your mailboxes, it can be a pain to set the permissions on all of your mailboxes.
Except if you use this nice little powershell command:
What this command will do is to add Full mailbox access to every mailbox in your Exchange organization for the user admin.
You can of course change the -AccessRights setting to your liking, e.</description>

      <description>Often it’s a good idea to have a receive connector allowing certain devices to send mail through you exchange server without having to authenticate.
One example from where I currently work is printers.
We never set up the printers ourselves, that job is done by the provider. And do we want to give them a username and password allowing for mail relay through our servers? No, we don’t.
It’s a better practice to have them only input the name/ip-address of one exchange server with the cas role.</description>

      <description>At work we are currently migrating to a new active directory domain. The migration hos gone rather smoothly except for a couple of users who are not able to sync mail on their phones.
After a little research I found the following events in the event log on our exchange CAS server:

I have tried this on a HP DL380 G6 and it worked like a charm.
One of the advantages of using that kind of server is that it has internal usb ports so you don’t have to worry about someone accidentally unplugging the usb drive.
Why should I run a server os from a usb drive you may ask. Well, the biggest advantage is that if your storing all virtual machines on e.</description>

      <description>Stumbled upon a tool from Microsoft called ALTools that I thought were absolutely awesome. It’s over 7 years old so I wonder why I haven’t seen it before
Nevertheless it’s as cool now as it was when it was released.
ALTools consists of several tools, but the coolest of them are:
aloinfo – Displays all user account names and the age of their passwords eventcombMT – Gathers specific events from event logs of several different machines and saves them in a text file LockoutStatus – Shows a list of all domain controllers in a given domain and the lockoutstatus of a given user on those I have used eventcomb a couple of times as it has some predefined searches, for example Account Lockouts.</description>
