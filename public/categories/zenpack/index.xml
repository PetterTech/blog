      <description>At the company where I currently work we lease a bunch of Xerox copiers. Those leasing contracts are based on number of prints per device.
That means that once a month we have to gather pagecounts from all our printers (about 100 of them) and report them to our supplier, which takes a lot of time.
Since we already were using Zenoss for monitoring of the printers I figured I could try and gather the information via snmp.</description>
